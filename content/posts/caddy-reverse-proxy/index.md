## Introduction

Caddy makes setting up a reverse proxy with [Automatic HTTPS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https) very trivial as the examples below show. They both:

* Proxy all, including WebSocket, traffic from <https://bana.io/api> to a server called `backend` listening on port `8080`, see [`reverse-proxy`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy).
* Enables directory browsing, see [`browse`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/file_server#browse).
* Enables gzip compression [`gzip`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/encode#gzip).
* Turn on request logging, see [`log`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#log).
* Enable error logging. Although this isn’t strictly needed, it helps to turn it on.

## Prerequisites

Setup DNS records to point to the server that is going to run Caddy. This is the simpler approach and that used in the examples. See [DNS Challenge](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#dns-challenge).

The certificates obtained are stored on disk in the folder `$HOME/.caddy` or, if `$HOME` is not set, in the current working directory of the `caddy` process in a folder named `.caddy`. If you’re running Caddy via Docker, it’s a good idea to make sure that you use volumes for this/these.

## Development `Caddyfile`

When you're initially developing it's a good idea to test against the staging/development url, see [Testing, developing, and advanced setups](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#testing). We do this by specifying the ca as <https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory>, otherwise it is identical to the production `Caddyfile`.

```Caddyfile
bana.io www.bana.io {
  proxy /api backend:8080 {
    websocket
    transparent
  }

  tls m@bana.io {
    ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
  }

  log stdout
  errors stderr

  browse
  gzip
}
```

## Production `Caddyfile`

```Caddyfile
bana.io www.bana.io {
  proxy /api backend:8080 {
    websocket
    transparent
  }

  tls m@bana.io

  log stdout
  errors stderr

  browse
  gzip
}
```

## Run

Use the [caddy-docker](https://github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker) Docker image or:

```sh
$ caddy --conf Caddyfile --log stdout --agree=yes
```
